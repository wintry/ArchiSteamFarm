<!--
I fully read and understood contributing guidelines of ASF available under https://github.com/JustArchi/ArchiSteamFarm/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md, especially the point that GITHUB IS NOT A TECHNICAL SUPPORT - IT'S THE PLACE ONLY FOR ASF BUGS AND SUGGESTIONS.

I admit that THIS IS NOT A QUESTION OR TECHNICAL ISSUE - I fully understand that ASF GitHub is ONLY for ASF development purpose. I strongly believe that the enhancement I'm suggesting here will benefit ASF and its users in the long-run, and that it's definitely not related to any technical difficulty I'm experiencing that is explained in the FAQ or other place of the wiki.

If my issue is not meeting contributing guidelines specified above, especially if it's a question or technical issue that is not related to ASF development in any way, please close it immediately - I won't complain.

## Feature request

### Purpose

<!-- Purpose of the feature request - if it solves some problem, precise what in particular. If it benefits the program in some other way, precise in particular why. Present the underlying reason why this feature request makes sense. -->

### Solution

<!-- What would you like to see as a solution to the purpose specified by you above? -->

### Why currently available solutions are not sufficient?

<!-- If something you're suggesting is already possible, then explain to us why currently available solutions are not sufficient. If it's not possible yet, then explain to us why it should be. -->

### Does your suggestion fall into ASF scope?

<!-- Is ASF really the proper tool to include your enhancement in the first place? Is it connected with idling Steam cards? -->

### Is your suggestion abiding to Steam ToS?

<!-- If not, it will not be considered. Botting Steam Market is just a single example of a thing that won't happen - https://store.steampowered.com/subscriber_agreement. -->

### Additional info

<!-- Everything else you consider worthy that we didn't ask for. -->
