<!--
I fully read and understood contributing guidelines of ASF available under https://github.com/JustArchi/ArchiSteamFarm/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md, especially the point that GITHUB IS NOT A TECHNICAL SUPPORT - IT'S THE PLACE ONLY FOR ASF BUGS AND SUGGESTIONS.

I admit that THIS IS NOT A QUESTION OR TECHNICAL ISSUE - I fully understand that ASF GitHub is ONLY for ASF development purpose. I strongly believe that the bug I'm reporting here affects majority of ASF users and that it's not a result of technical difficulty I'm experiencing that is explained in the FAQ or other place of the wiki.

If my issue is not meeting contributing guidelines specified above, especially if it's a question or technical issue that is not related to ASF development in any way, please close it immediately - I won't complain.
